Geolocation Tracker
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Geolocation Tracker built using Python. It fetches the geolocation of a user or a specified IP address and displays the location on an interactive map in the browser. The application also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

🛠 Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
- Install Python
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
- Install Required Libraries
- Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install the required libraries: pip install requests folium
- Install a Code Editor
- Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code for writing and running the Python script.

🛠 Step 2: Write the Geolocation Tracker Code
- Create a New Python File
- Create a new Python file named geolocation_tracker.py.

- Write the Code
- Copy and paste the provided Python code into the file. The code includes:

- Fetching geolocation data using the ip-api.com API.
- Displaying the geolocation data in a GUI.
- Opening the location on an interactive map in the browser.

🛠 Step 3: Run the Geolocation Tracker
- Run the Script
- Open the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run: pip install requests folium

Use the Application
- Enter an IP address in the input field (or leave it blank to fetch your own IP's geolocation).
- Click the "Fetch Location" button to display the geolocation data and open the map in your browser.
- Use the "Exit" button to close the application.

📌 Features
Fetches geolocation data for any IP address.
Displays geolocation data (latitude, longitude, city, region, country, and IP).
Opens an interactive map in the browser with the location marked.
User-friendly GUI built with tkinter.

📌 Limitations
The accuracy of the location depends on the IP-based geolocation service (ip-api.com), which may not always be precise.
For better accuracy, consider using a paid geolocation API like Google Maps Geolocation API.

Enjoy tracking geolocations! 🌍
