Hangman Game
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a Hangman Game built using Python and the tkinter library. It is a visually appealing word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by entering one letter at a time. The game provides hints, tracks incorrect guesses, and displays a hangman figure as the player makes mistakes.

- Install Python
  Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
- Install Visual Studio Code
  Download and install Visual Studio Code.
- Install Required Libraries
  The game uses the built-in tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with Python. No additional libraries are required.

ðŸ›  Step 2: Write the Hangman Game Code
- Create a New Python File
- Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file named hangman_game.py.
