ðŸ›  Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
- Install Python
Download and install Python from python.org.
- Install Required Libraries
Use the following command to install the necessary Python libraries: pip install tkinter pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition wikipedia
- Install a Code Editor
Install a code editor like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for writing and running the code.

ðŸ›  Step 2: Write the Voice Assistant Code
- Create a New Python File
Create a Python file (e.g., voice_assistant.py) in your project directory.
- Write the Code
- Write or copy the Voice Assistant code into the file. The code includes:
- A GUI built with Tkinter.
- Functions for text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and executing tasks like searching Google, YouTube, or Wikipedia.

ðŸ›  Step 3: Run the Voice Assistant
- Run the Python File
- Execute the Python file in your terminal or code editor: python voice_assistant.py

- Interact with the Assistant
Enter text or speak commands like:
"Search Python programming."
"YouTube Python tutorials."
"Wikipedia Artificial Intelligence."
View the assistant's responses in the GUI output area.
