üêç Python Internship

üìå Overview
This repository contains all the projects and tasks I completed during my Python Internship.  
Each task focuses on building problem-solving skills and applying core Python concepts in creative and practical ways.

üìÇ Internship Tasks

Task #01: Fibonacci Generator
- Objective: Generate a Fibonacci sequence using a Python script.
- Description: The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This task helped in understanding recursion and iterative solutions.
- Concepts Used: Loops, Recursion, Mathematical Logic

Task #02: Voice Assistant
- Objective: Build a personalized voice assistant using Python.
- Description: This Python-based voice assistant can perform basic automation tasks such as greeting the user, opening websites, or answering queries.
- Concepts Used: speech_recognition, pyttsx3, webbrowser, datetime

Task #03: Hangman Game
- Objective: Create a text-based version of the classic Hangman game.
- Description: Players guess letters to complete a hidden word within limited attempts. It enhances understanding of strings, loops, and conditionals.
- Concepts Used: String manipulation, Lists, Loops, User Input

Task #04: Student Grade Tracker
- Objective: Develop a program to track student grades and calculate their average.
- Description: Allows users to input subjects and grades, then calculates and displays the average and performance.
- Concepts Used: Dictionaries, Functions, Input/Output, Arithmetic Operations

Task #05: Geolocation Tracker
- Objective: Develop a script to fetch the user's geolocation using an IP address and display it on a map.
- Description: Utilizes third-party APIs to extract IP-based location data and visualize it using Python libraries.
- Concepts Used: requests, APIs, folium, JSON handling

Task #06: Memory Puzzle Game
- Objective: Implement a memory puzzle game where users match pairs of cards within a time limit.
- Description: A fun concentration-based puzzle game built using Python GUI libraries. Users flip cards to find matching pairs, with time pressure to enhance difficulty.
- Concepts Used: GUI development (tkinter or pygame), Loops, Timers, Lists, Logic
